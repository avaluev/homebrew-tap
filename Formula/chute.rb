  # VERSION comes from Sources/ChuteCore/Version.swift — the one place it lives. Bump both
  # together: tag the release, then update this line to match.

  # IN SYNC as of 2026-09-09. This file is a COPY, not the tap — publishing means running
  # packaging/homebrew/README.md's steps 4-6 against avaluev/homebrew-tap. Verified that day:
  # the live tap and this file pin the same version and the same sha256, and that sha256 is
  # what the tarball actually hashes to. An outdated note here saying otherwise is worse than
  # no note — one such note, left over from 2026-09-08, was read by an outside auditor in
  # 2026-09-09 as evidence that `brew install` was broken. If you correct this file, correct
  # this paragraph in the same commit.

  # Recompute on every version bump — AND after any history rewrite. A force-push changes
  # every tag's generated tarball: on 2026-09-09 the rewrite that removed private files
  # silently broke `brew install avaluev/tap/chute` for every new user, and it took THREE
  # corrective commits that day to settle, because the failure only shows on a cold cache.

  # CHECK IT WITH `brew fetch --force avaluev/tap/chute`, NOT `brew install` — install is happy
  # with a tarball it already cached, so it is structurally incapable of catching this bug.

  # macOS 13 is the floor declared in Package.swift. The version form ALONE — no bare
